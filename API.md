* The bored database consists of a collection of Posts.
* Posts may have one or multiple Tags, which are used in search queries to get related images. Tags are all in lower_snake_case.
  * Tags may have namespaces, which can be used to denote artists (`artist:`) franchises (`franchise:`), characters (`character:`), and so on. Tags will be colored and sorted based on their namespace.
* Posts may be put in collections, which are separated from regular tags.
* Tags may be given wiki pages to further describe the tag and where it should be used.
* Users may add posts to their favorites.
